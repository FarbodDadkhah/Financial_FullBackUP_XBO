# Troubleshooting Common Issues

## Online Banking Access

### Locked Account
After 5 failed login attempts, online banking is locked for 30 minutes. If the customer cannot wait:
1. Verify identity with full SSN, date of birth, and security question
2. Perform manual unlock in the admin portal under Account Management > Security
3. Advise customer to reset password after unlock

### Password Reset
Customers can self-service password reset via the "Forgot Password" link. They will receive a verification code via email or SMS. If they cannot access either:
1. Verify identity as above
2. Update contact information if needed
3. Trigger a manual password reset email to the verified address

### Mobile App Issues
Common mobile app problems and solutions:
- **App crashes on login**: Clear app cache and data, then reinstall. Check minimum OS requirements (iOS 15+ or Android 12+).
- **Mobile deposit not working**: Ensure camera permissions are granted. Check that deposit is within limits ($5,000/day for standard accounts, $10,000/day for premium).
- **Biometric login fails**: Remove and re-enroll fingerprint/face ID in device settings, then re-enable in app settings.

## Card Issues

### Declined Transactions
Common reasons for card declines:
- Insufficient funds (check available balance, not current balance)
- Daily spending limit exceeded ($5,000 default for debit, varies for credit)
- Travel lock triggered (check if customer is out of their home state/country)
- Merchant category blocked (gambling, cryptocurrency purchases blocked by default)
- Card expired or not yet activated

To resolve: verify the specific decline reason in the card management system, address the root cause, and attempt the transaction again.

### Card Not Arriving
Standard delivery is 7-10 business days from issuance. If not received after 10 business days:
1. Verify mailing address is correct
2. Check card status in the system (may show delivered, in transit, or returned)
3. If delivered but not received, treat as potential fraud - cancel and reissue
4. Offer expedited shipping ($25) for replacement

## Direct Deposit Issues

If a customer's direct deposit is missing:
1. Confirm the employer has the correct routing (021000089) and account number
2. Check if the deposit date is a bank holiday (deposits process next business day)
3. Verify the account is open and in good standing (holds or restrictions block deposits)
4. If the deposit was sent to a closed account, it will be returned to the originator within 2-3 business days
