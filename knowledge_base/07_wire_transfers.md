# Wire Transfers

## Domestic Wire Transfers

### Sending Domestic Wires
Domestic wires can be initiated in-branch or via online banking (must be pre-enrolled for online wires). Required information:
- Recipient's full legal name
- Recipient's bank name, routing number, and account number
- Amount and purpose of transfer

Processing: Domestic wires submitted before 4:00 PM ET are processed same-day. Wires submitted after 4:00 PM ET are processed the next business day. Fee: $25 per outgoing domestic wire.

### Receiving Domestic Wires
Incoming domestic wires are credited to the account within 1-2 hours of receipt during business hours. No fee for incoming domestic wires. Customers should provide the sender with:
- Bank name and address
- Routing number: 021000089
- Account number
- Account holder's full name

## International Wire Transfers

### Sending International Wires
International wires require additional information:
- Recipient's SWIFT/BIC code
- Recipient's IBAN (for European and many other countries)
- Recipient's full bank name and address
- Intermediary bank details (if applicable)
- Purpose of transfer (required for compliance)

Processing: International wires take 2-5 business days depending on the destination country and intermediary banks. Fee: $45 per outgoing international wire. Exchange rates are set at the time of processing and include a 1.5% markup over the mid-market rate.

### Receiving International Wires
Incoming international wires may take 1-3 business days to post. Fee: $15 for incoming international wires. The amount credited may differ from the amount sent due to intermediary bank fees and exchange rate fluctuations.

## Wire Transfer Limits

- Online banking: $10,000 per day, $25,000 per month
- In-branch: $100,000 per day for personal accounts, $500,000 for business accounts
- Wires above $50,000 require additional verification and may trigger a 24-hour hold for new recipients

## Wire Transfer Safety

Representatives must verify wire instructions with the customer directly. Do NOT accept wire instructions received solely via email, as this is a common fraud vector. For wires over $10,000, call the customer at the phone number on file to verify. Suspicious wire requests should be escalated to the Fraud Prevention team at ext. 5000.

## Cancellations and Recalls

Domestic wires may be recalled within 30 minutes of submission if not yet processed. After processing, recall attempts are made on a best-effort basis and are not guaranteed. International wires cannot be recalled once submitted to the SWIFT network. Recall fee: $25 domestic, $50 international.
