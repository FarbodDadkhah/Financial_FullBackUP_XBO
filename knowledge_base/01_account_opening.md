# Account Opening Procedures

## Personal Checking Accounts

To open a personal checking account, the customer must provide:
- Valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license, passport, or state ID)
- Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
- Proof of address dated within the last 60 days (utility bill, lease agreement, or bank statement)
- Minimum opening deposit of $25

Processing time is typically same-day for in-branch applications. Online applications may take 1-2 business days for identity verification.

## Savings Accounts

Savings accounts require the same documentation as checking accounts. The minimum opening deposit is $50. Interest rates are tiered based on balance:
- $0 - $9,999: 0.50% APY
- $10,000 - $49,999: 1.25% APY
- $50,000+: 2.00% APY

## Business Accounts

Business accounts require additional documentation:
- Employer Identification Number (EIN) or SSN for sole proprietors
- Articles of Incorporation or Certificate of Organization
- Business license (if applicable)
- Operating agreement or bylaws
- Beneficial ownership information for all owners with 25%+ stake

Business checking minimum opening deposit is $100. Business savings minimum is $500.

## Joint Accounts

Joint accounts can be opened by two or more individuals. All account holders must be present at account opening (or complete separate identity verification if applying online). Each holder has equal rights to the account unless otherwise specified in writing.

## Minor Accounts

Accounts for minors (under 18) require a parent or legal guardian as co-owner. The minor must provide a birth certificate or school ID, and the guardian must provide standard identification. Minor accounts have no minimum balance requirements and no monthly fees.

## Account Opening Restrictions

Accounts cannot be opened for individuals who:
- Are on the OFAC sanctions list
- Have had an account closed by the bank for fraud within the past 5 years
- Cannot complete identity verification through standard or enhanced procedures
- Are under 13 years of age (even with guardian co-ownership)
