# Fraud and Disputes

## Reporting Fraud

If a customer reports suspected fraud, take immediate action:
1. **Block the card** or freeze the account to prevent further unauthorized transactions
2. **Document all details**: transaction dates, amounts, merchant names, and how the customer became aware
3. **File a fraud claim** in the Fraud Management System (FMS) - this generates a case number
4. **Provide the case number** to the customer and set expectations for the investigation timeline

Emergency fraud hotline for customers: 1-800-555-0199 (24/7)
Internal fraud escalation: ext. 5000

## Investigation Timeline

- **Provisional credit**: For debit card fraud, provisional credit is issued within 10 business days of the claim. For credit card fraud, the disputed amount is removed from the statement immediately.
- **Investigation period**: Up to 45 days for domestic transactions, up to 90 days for international transactions or point-of-sale disputes.
- **Resolution**: Customer is notified in writing of the investigation outcome. If the claim is denied, the provisional credit is reversed with 5 business days notice.

## Common Fraud Types

### Card Skimming
Unauthorized copying of card data, typically at ATMs or gas pumps. Signs: multiple small charges at unfamiliar merchants. Action: replace the card, file fraud claim, advise customer to monitor statements.

### Phishing/Social Engineering
Customer tricked into providing login credentials or personal information. Signs: unauthorized online transfers or password changes. Action: lock online banking, reset credentials, file fraud claim, check if contact information was changed.

### Check Fraud
Forged, altered, or counterfeit checks. Signs: checks with unfamiliar handwriting, altered amounts, or duplicate check numbers. Action: place hold on account, file fraud claim, may require affidavit of forgery.

### Account Takeover
Unauthorized access to the customer's account through stolen credentials. Signs: changed contact info, new payees added, large transfers to unknown accounts. Action: freeze all accounts, reset all access, file fraud claim, verify all recent changes with customer.

## Dispute Process (Non-Fraud)

For billing disputes (merchant issues, not fraud):
1. Advise customer to first attempt resolution with the merchant
2. If unresolved, file a dispute through the card network (Visa/Mastercard)
3. Customer must provide documentation: receipts, correspondence with merchant, description of issue
4. Dispute processing takes 30-60 days
5. Chargeback rights expire 120 days from the transaction date

## Customer Liability

- **Debit cards**: Customer liability is $0 if reported within 2 business days, up to $50 if reported within 60 days, and unlimited after 60 days (per Regulation E)
- **Credit cards**: Maximum $50 liability per Federal law; bank policy waives all liability for prompt reporting
- **Online banking**: $0 liability for unauthorized transfers if reported within 60 days of the statement date

## Prevention Tips for Customers

Advise customers to:
- Enable transaction alerts for all purchases over $1
- Use virtual card numbers for online shopping
- Never share PINs, passwords, or one-time codes with anyone
- Review statements monthly and report discrepancies immediately
- Set up two-factor authentication on online and mobile banking
